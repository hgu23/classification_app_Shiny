# Shiny_Classification_App
 A shiny classification app to find the best classification model for a specific dataset. Allows selection of a series of pre-processing steps and choose a specific classification model from the  entire collection of models available in the R Caret package.  Applied on the famous Titanic dataset to predict who survived the infamous Titanic sinking based on a variety of different features. 
 
 The SavedModels folder contains the saved models already tried using the App. 
 The test and train datasets show the details of the different passengers to predict whether they survived the journey or not ( as shown by the 'Survived' column in the training set.)
